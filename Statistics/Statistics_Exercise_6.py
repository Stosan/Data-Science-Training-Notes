# ## EXERCISE 1. 
# The hourly wages in a particular industry are normally distributed with mean  $13.20  and  standard deviation $2.50. A company in this industry employs 40 workers, paying them an average of $12.20 per hour. Can this company be accused of paying substandard wages? Use an Î± = .01 level test.

# ## EXERCISE 2.
# Shear strength measurements derived from unconfined compression tests for two types of soils gave the results shown in the following document (measurements in tons per square foot). Do the soils appear to differ with respect to average shear strength, at the 1% significance level?
